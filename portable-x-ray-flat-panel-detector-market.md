<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Portable X-Ray Flat Panel Detector market is categorized into two main types: Direct Conversion and Indirect Conversion. Direct Conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using amorphous selenium, resulting in higher image quality and faster processing times. In contrast, Indirect Conversion detectors utilize a two-step process, where X-rays are first converted into light, then into electrical signals through photodiode arrays. While Indirect Conversion is often more cost-effective, Direct Conversion offers superior resolution, making it essential for diverse medical imaging applications.</p></p>
